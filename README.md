# Battleship

A full-stack app that matches two simultaneous users to play battleship, the strategy game.

## Running the server

The server manages matchmaking and UI. It depends on docker to run. It can run locally but I don't recommend that.

### Prerequisites

To start a local instance of the server, clone this repository.

And run the following commands:

    make start
    make migrate
